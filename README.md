# Welcome to dbump!
dbump is a easy to use, simple, and safe Discord Bumping bot!

# How do I use?
Inviting the bot and setup is easy. Simply go to https://dbump.org/bot/invite and invite the bot to your server. Then run $setup for the automated setup. In less then 5 minutes, you should be good to go!

# How do I selfhost?
Thank you for your interest in wanting to selfhost! This can be done very easily in the newest version of dbump.
You will need the following to do this, however:
- Node.JS
- pgAdmin 4 + PostgresDB w/ admin user
- MySQL (Can be localized, we recommend using xampp for windows hosts)
- Git clone of the bot
- Discord developer application

To get the bot running with a custom instance:
- Download the preqs
- Open config.json in your IDE (Don't use notepad, that'd be a disaster)
- Fill in required values
- Save
- Start the .js file using Node then navigate to localhost:0333 to start setting up the custom instance and administrating it
- Invite it to your server
- Finished!
### LEGAL REMINDER! You're free to do this for non-commerical use as long as you leave the credit in the $help command. However, if you do not respect the license, we have the right to suspend your version of the bot or submit a DMCA takedown request. If you think you should be exempt from this, contact me on discord: ambience#9775
## Please note however that you'll need a custom domain to get the full experience. If you set yourself as an admin on your bot, you will automatically have premium status.
# What does Premium do?
Premium is a way to donate to the developers of dbump so you can get front page of dbump, front support, decreased bumping timers, and more! To donate, go to https://dbump.org/buy

# How do I safely remove dbump from my server?
Firstly, we're sorry you came to the decision to remove dbump from your server. If you wish to remove the bot, please do not kick the bot immediately. Instead do "$leaveguild" to safely remove the bot and undo all changes it made to your guild.

# I want to apply for staff!

# I want to contribute!

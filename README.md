# Welcome.
## This will cover what you need to know about dbump, my bot.

# What is dbump?
## dbump (Discord Bump) is a Discord bot, made by uni2004/ambience in JS.

# How do I use the bot?
## Simply invite the bot to your server, type "$setup -b" on your server and let it setup!
## Once done, you can go to https://servers.dbump.org and see your own server there which people can join.

# How do I get my server higher on the lists?
## Each time you bump, you get more "dbump points". The more points you have, the higher your server is on the list! 
## Alternatively, you can by premium at https://purchase.dbump.org/ and you can automatically have your server at the top of the lists!

# I want my own copy of the bot. How do I install something like this?
## We do not support selfhosting. Myself and our developers worked hard and we'd like this to be the only instance of the bot.
## We also use a lot of closed source utilities and installing the bot will be a nightmare. If you still want to, go ahead, but we do not give support out and you need to follow the license. We have the right to suspend/terminate your instance of the bot or DMCA takedown your bot.

# I no longer want the bot in my server.
## We're sorry you no longer want our bot. However, in order to remove it, you shouldn't recommend it as it won't undo stuff like webhooks, channels or anything. If you want to do this quickly, do "$leave" to make the bot undo all changes it made to your guild, and then you can kick the bot. If you have an active premium license, do "$leave" then contact us at payments@dbump.org to refund your licenses.

# Thank you for using dbump!

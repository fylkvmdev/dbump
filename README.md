# Attention: At May 24, 2020 we have made the decision to shutdown the dbump bot. All the websites have been cancelled. If you had an active premium plan, it has been refunded. The bot has been removed from all 120 guilds safely. Thank you for using. All source code has been deleted too from this repository. If you're a developer and you want it, let me know. 
# Welcome to dbump!
dbump is a easy to use, simple, and safe Discord Bumping bot!

# How do I use?
Using is easy. Invite the bot to your server using https://dbump.org/server/add and do "$setup". This will initialize your server to be setup with dbump. After you are done, type "$bump" and your server will be bumped to https://dbump.org/server

# How do I selfhost?
Unfortunately, Selfhosting is not allowed on dbump. We run on a lot of closed source modules and other codes and running the bot on someone elses server/PC would be a nightmare.

# What does Premium do?
Premium is a way to donate to the developers of dbump so you can get front page of dbump, front support, decreased bumping timers, and more! To donate, go to https://dbump.org/buy

# How do I safely remove dbump from my server?
Firstly, we're sorry you came to the decision to remove dbump from your server. If you wish to remove the bot, please do not kick the bot immediately. Instead do "$leaveguild" to safely remove the bot and undo all changes it made to your guild.

# I want to apply for staff!
Thank you for your decision to apply for staff. You can apply for bot staff at https://staff.dbump.org and server staff at https://staff.server.dbump.org. 

# Enjoy the bot!
